# My very first web page...
*A tiny documentation of My very first web page*

### What is this?

This is a web page containing the most common languages, tools and links pointing the needed knowledge to develop a project

### Is this web page ready?

Yes, I followed all the intructions explained in the video and also I contributed, for the very first time, to update some code containing a broken link to an image.

## Web structure

- Three HTMLs with links in rows.

## Table of Contents (HTML Code links)

- [Stream one](https://github.com/danmtt/my-first-website/blob/master/index.html "Stream One")
