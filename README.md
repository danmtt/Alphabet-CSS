# My very first git project...
*A tiny documentation of My very first GIT project*

### What is this?

This is a project aimed to apply as much as CSS rules learnt during the first 3 modules on Full Stack Developer course.

### Is this project ready?

As you can see, there are many folders containing the steps taken. It is not finished and I understand it won't ever be. 
As soon as I learn a new CSS rule that I think it can match, I try to upload it to the code...

## Project Structure

- Several folders numbered to track and check the develop achieved.

## History

- Alphabet_01: In this folder it can be found the first HTML file aimed to design the structure and the first CSS file with the very first rules applied to the HTML.

- Alphabet_02: In this folder the changes made are aimed to make the initial design more clear and structured, applying new rules learnt. The differences are clear. White color is dominant and :hover rule makes its appearance. The chance of applying java to join sounds to the letters when hovering starts being a possibility... 

- Alphabet_03: This folder contains changes in the HTML structure and new CSS rules. Slight changes made because starting the Animations chapter. Waiting to finish it to apply more changes... 

- Alphabet_04: In this folder CSS animations start to appear. Also HTML structure changes, clearing unnecessary code...Let's make them dance and see if they match the final goal for the site: Practice, practice and practice and to make the site approachable to any age and funny!
